# SoLO_flare_movies
This repository contains python scripts that can be used to create movies of solar flares from Solar Orbiter Data using SunPy. More specifically, there are two Jupyter Notebooks, FSI174.ipynb and FSI304.ipynb, that are either used to analyze Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) - Data of the Full Sun Imager (FSI) subsystem at 174Å or 304Å, respectively.
For specific documentation of the code code, see comments and texts in the Jupyter Notebook files.

Furthermore, there are four folders containing solar flare movies that either show the full size solar disk (ending with "F") or a limited FOV of the part of the solar disc where the flare occurs.

All flare events within a certain time period are documented in the csv files.
